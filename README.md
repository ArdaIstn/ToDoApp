# üìã ToDoApp

ToDoApp is a task management Android application built using Kotlin and designed to demonstrate clean architecture practices with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. This project offers a simple yet efficient way to manage daily tasks, allowing users to create, update, and delete tasks.

## üöÄ Features
1. **Create New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks with a title and description.
2. **Edit Tasks:** Update task details as needed.
3. **Delete Tasks:** Remove completed or unnecessary tasks with a simple swipe(left) gesture.
4. **Priority Sorting:** Sort tasks based on their priority level (High To Low or Low To High)for better task management.
5. **Task List View:** Displays all tasks in a clear, organized list view.
6. **Search Functionality:** Easily search for tasks by title.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used
- **Kotlin:** A modern programming language that enhances productivity with its expressive syntax, null safety, and seamless interoperability with Java.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** A design pattern that separates UI logic from business logic, promoting a clean architecture and facilitating easier testing and maintenance.

- **XML:** Used for defining UI layouts in Android applications, providing a clear structure for designing interfaces.

- **Navigation Component:** A library that simplifies navigation in Android apps, providing a consistent way to handle fragment transactions and passing data between screens.

- **Hilt:** A dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the management of dependencies, making it easier to scale applications.

- **Room:** A persistent library for SQLite that abstracts database interactions, providing a robust framework for data storage and retrieval.

- **LiveData:** A lifecycle-aware observable data holder that allows UI components to observe changes in data, ensuring updates happen safely.

- **StateFlow:** A state management solution that represents a read-only state and allows for reactive programming, making it easier to manage UI state.
  
- **Coroutines:** A feature for asynchronous programming in Kotlin, enabling developers to write non-blocking code for smooth user experiences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Other Used Structured 

- **Swipe To Delete:** A gesture-based action that allows users to quickly remove items from a list, enhancing user experience.

- **DiffUtil:** A utility class that efficiently computes differences between two lists, optimizing the performance of RecyclerViews during updates.

- **Type Converter:** A mechanism in Room that allows custom data types to be stored in the database by converting them to and from a supported format.

- **Splash Screen:** A brief introductory screen that appears while the app is loading, improving user experience and branding.
